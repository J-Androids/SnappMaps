# snappmaps

Source code for the Maps app which powers the map display in the dashboard and the `SnappMaps` app.

This app is a very thin later on-top of [OSMDroid](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid) 

The objective of this project is to provide a easily usable application for folk requiring a maps provider on Android (e.g. for an Android Automotive OS firmware build). If you encounter any issues using the software please [raise an issue](https://github.com/snappautomotive/SnappMaps/issues)
